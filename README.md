1.4 installation

We have 3 options to dawnload ROS.

Desktop-Full Install: Everything in Desktop plus 2D/3D simulators and 2D/3D perception packages 

Desktop Install: Everything in ROS-Base plus tools like rqt and rviz

ROS-Base: ROS packaging, build, and communication libraries. No GUI tools. 

So, in our case, we will download the Desktop-Full Install.
